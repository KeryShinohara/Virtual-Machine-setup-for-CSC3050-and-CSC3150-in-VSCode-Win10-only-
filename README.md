# Virtual-Machine-setup-for-CSC3050-and-CSC3150-in-VSCode-Win10-only-

This is a tutorial on how to setup the virtual machines for CUHKSZ CSC3050 and CSC3150.

Note that the pdf provided in the course is enough, hence I only give some instructions on how to connect to VM on VSCode and how to avoid password.
